# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

During the course Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python I have worked on a couple of problem sets.
In this repository you find my coding solutions for these problem sets.

**Problem set 0.5:**
A very small assignment supplied in the first lecture to get familiar with strings, input and print.

**Problem set 1:**
Is a compound interest calculator, to calculate required time of saving money for a downpayment on a house.
This assignments builds gradely in complexity and shows the strength of programming for solving mathematical problems.
The assingment and requirements for the compound interest calculator can be found in MIT6_0001F16_PSet1.pdf.

**Problem set 2:**
A game of hangman with hints, and requires the file words_ps2.txt to run. Feel free to try a game.
How the game works and the hint requirements can be found in MIT6_0001F16_PSet2.pdf

**Problem set 3:**
A scrabble based word game, and requires the file words_ps3.txt to run.
You get a hand of 7 letters and try to make words using this letters. With the remaining letters you can try to make a second word. 
Points are rewarded based on the letters used and word length.
All rules and requirments are explained in MIT6_0001F16_PSet3.pdf

**Problem set 4:**
This problem set is divided in three aspect and works towards a text encrypter/decrypter.
Part A is focussed on creating a recursive function to solve the permutation problem.
Part B is a text encrypter/decrypter using Ceasar cipher.
Part C is a text encrypter/decrypter using a substitution cipher, part A comes in handy here to crack the subtition cipher used.
The assignment and it's requirements can be found in MIT6_0001F16_PSet4.pdf 

**problem set 5:**
Filter googles RSS newsfeed data on title, description, time and date.
With this problemset a python program for automated testing was supplied. 
So every filter method functionality could be tested during programming.
The requirments can be found in MIT6_0001F16_PSet5.pdf 

# How to build

Clone this repository using git:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Bram-van-Trigt/python_basics_course.git
```

# How to use
The problem sets can be started in the terminal by running the .py file of the specific problem set.
_Note: problem set 5 can't be used as it has dependencies to files from the course not uploaded in this repository_
